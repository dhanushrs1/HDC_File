## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Storage:** Admin sends a file to the bot.
2. **Database:** Bot copies the file to a private "database" Telegram channel.
3. **Link Generation:** Bot generates a unique, permanent link (e.g., `https://your-redirector.com/?start=...`).
4. **Redirection:** User clicks the link, lands on your redirector page, which redirects to the bot with a special start code.
5. **Delivery:** Bot decodes the start code, finds the file, and sends it to the user.
